### üìù Notes

- Kendall‚Äôs presentation  
  - Direct interested potential partners to new form:   
  - Project ‚Äúreadiness‚Äù  
    - Finding mentors with enough time & knowledge   
    - More than one mentor per project (allows room for life, vacations, etc. to happen)  
    - Nate: CNCF categorizes projects, in part by how established their contributor ladder is  
  - Structure  
    - Depends on the project, mentors, institutions \- mentors have enough experience to set the format  
    - The ideal is to have mentors mentor other people into being mentors üôÇ  
  - Biggest barrier to scaling:  
    - Organization, logistics  
    - Mentor burnout / capacity
