- Emily Lovell, Postdoc @ UC Santa Cruz OSPO  
- Clif Kussmaul, Principal Consultant, Green Mango Associates  
- David Benjamin, Nate W, Lance A, Tyler M

### üìù Notes

- CodeDay (Tyler) happy to host the grant  
- via Tyler: travel costs for conference participants go under participant support which usually doesn't incur indirect; IDC would only apply for PI travel/payments  
- CodeDay can submit to maximize funding for activities (10 or 15% IDC; much lower than UCSC‚Äôs)  
- Scientific Python is hosting a [working event](https://scientific-python.org/summits/developer/2025/) this summer \- some nice inspiration for how to pitch expectations, goals of such an event  
- TODO: Clif: share revised proposal on Discord, 24h to respond  
- David Benjamin: should we propose an event at [Southern CA Linux Expo (SCaLE)](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/22x) \- timeline to do so would be August/September (likely could get space for ¬Ω day event)
