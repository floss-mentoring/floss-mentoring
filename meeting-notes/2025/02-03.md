### üìù Notes

- CNCF LFX 2025 Term 1 (March-May) program opening for candidate applications this week (Wed, Feb 5\)  
  - [https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/tree/main/programs/lfx-mentorship/2025/01-Mar-May](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/tree/main/programs/lfx-mentorship/2025/01-Mar-May)   
  - First of Spring, Summer, Fall rounds  
  - Full time(ish) time commitment for mentees  
  - 2 mentors/project, scoped for the timeframe  
  - Fully remote \- 150 mentees/year  
- How can initiatives grow their capacity? Engage more local participants? (Great q‚Äôs/thoughts from Devin)  
- SIGCSE Teaching Open Source (TOS) and Professor‚Äôs Open Source Software Experience (POSSE) event: [https://teachingopensource.org/SIGCSE\_2025\_Affiliated\_Event](https://teachingopensource.org/SIGCSE_2025_Affiliated_Event)  
- Event proposal discussion:  
  - Location feedback   
    - Albany has direct flights on Southwest\! RCOS could possible offer space (maybe ‚Äì Troy is 20m from Albany)  
    - RedHat used to host events \- would they do it again?  
    - Scheduling at an academic institution can draw people from that location; OSU could possibly host (shuttles exist from PDX \-\> Corvallis)  
  - Timing?  
    - Summer is good for academic institutions to host  
    - October could also work  
  - 25-30 people seems about right  
  - Schedule:  
    - Coffee is important\!  
    - Noting that the third day is more than a half-day ‚Äì we will probably need to adjust first and third day according to geographic location/projected travel ‚Äì make sure to represent accurately to people who might like to participate :)   
  - Expected goals/deliverables:  
    - Important to emphasize this in proposal  
    - Identify common challenges \-\> can guide our future work  
    - Capturing ‚Äúpatterns‚Äù / micro activities that people are already doing  
    - More pathways to jobs in open source‚Ä¶ how do we create or highlight them? (Job boards for mentees? Business/IP support for mentees who want to do their own thing? What other structure could there be for economic support to continue working in open source? \- Devin is working w/ a data org to better understand where people are going after their mentorship experience)  
  - How do we mentor mentees into a *career*?
