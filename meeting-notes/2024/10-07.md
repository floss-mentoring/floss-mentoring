### üìù Notes

-  Where does your funding come from?  
  - MinT: intentionally diverse revenue so program is sustainable and not one single macro issue will affect program continuity: some from schools, some from local city government (workforce development), state funding (small grants, NSF, etc), employer/company sponsorships (this used to be more, but less now), hoping to adding private foundations to the mix.  
  - RCOS RPI: Grant to start an open source program office, alumni grants, some from companies in industry like Red Hat  
  - Potentially a shift back to workforce development that doesn‚Äôt require college?  
- How do we scale?  
  - Peer mentors can help with this  
  - Offering course credit for undergrads can help balance $ cost  
- What do we bring to the table that‚Äôs distinct from existing cross-community efforts? (GSoC, Outreachy, etc.) ‚Äì how do we amplify impact without competing?  
- What steps exist between now and applying for funding together?  
  - **Directory** that notes our various interests to help teams w/ alignment emerge  
  - ‚ÄúGood first issues‚Äù who want to teach people to work through good first issues :)   
  - Determine areas in which to apply for funding together: themes / goals, programs, geographies, audiences, etc.  
  - Maybe a **forum** or some way to serve as a connector between people who are looking for others w/ matched needs, resources?  
  - **Combine our data on the impact of mentorship** in open source \- what does this look like? Sharing some quotes and graphics on our (yet to be made) webpage? Is it a white paper, a conference paper,....?  
    - How many mentees stay with the project beyond a program?  
    - How many mentees go on to work on other projects?  
    - How many mentees pursue or secure employment in open source (or more specifically tech)?  
    - Plus highlight individual stories ‚Äì blog posts, TikTok, how many other \[relatable\] ways can we tell these stories? And maybe lower the barrier to being able to tell the stories?  
    - Low hanging fruit: aggregate existing content (see links below\!)  
  - Maybe we can also help contributors learn how to better tell their own stories (to recruiters, etc)?  
    - MiNT is nailing this so let‚Äôs all learn from them\!  
    - How can we operationalize this into a tool or resource‚Ä¶.? CodeDay maybe has resources to scaffold this?  
    - 3 C‚Äôs, STAR as frameworks  
    - Example of STAR‚Ä¶.. Share an example of a time when you faced a difficult problem at work. How did you solve this problem?(ex: In my OSS project work at CNCF‚Ä¶)
