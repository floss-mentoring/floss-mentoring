### üìù Notes

- Unis Represented  
  - West Attica \- Greece  
  - Green River College  
  - Saint Louis University  
  - Oregon State University  
  - Czech Technical University  
  - University of El Salvador  
  - City University in Seattle  
- Key Challenges  
  - Finding faculty with capstone courses that are willing to engage with open source projects   
  - Expectations   
    - Students (may be expecting a more traditional class, get stuck)  
    - Faculty (intimidating to get started / change your course model)  
      - Lots of additional variable and uncertainty  
      - Faculty members can help each other understand and see value  
      - Knowing there are mentors to help out with students is a game changer  
        - Students accomplish more than they thought they might  
    - Maintainers (might want/expect student contributions to be flawless)  
    - Departments (may not appreciate the value of open source contribution, when the course focus isn‚Äôt on the code/technical aspects)  
  - How do we get open source in front of more professors focusing on teaching (the research focused profs are pretty involved already)?  
  - How do you scale up support for students in the projects?   
  - What do you need for students? To feel comfortable investing in open source in your classroom?  
    - Project description AND a person (mentor) to help support the students  
    - Understanding of project expectations  
    - $Something to bring to deans, head of departments, etc to rationalize why this is important \- depends on the Uni  
      - Value prop could be projects that support research  
      - Could be preparing students for job market  
  - SLU has a capstone course  
    - They take on projects from other researching profs on campus  
    - Near peer mentoring \- graduate students are tech leads for undergrads  
    - Hardest nut to crack is working on external projects  
    - To keep projects rolling, they are ‚Äòowned‚Äô by the grad (Masters) students and the OSPO  
      - A tad difficult to scale the projects themselves  
      - They have a 1-2 year SME commitment from a student  
  - What is valuable to YOU (a prof) from a group like this?   
    - Identify useful resources \- learning activities, reference/cheat sheets, tools to scaffold FLOSS work in academic settings, etc.  
    - Aligning/ building a collective case so that the folks who make the decisions on what to invest in can know that their money has a significant positive impact toward their goals  
- Future call ideas and goals  
  - Rapid fire all the things that we have tried that worked or didn‚Äôt work in broad strokes (lightning talks\!)  
  - Advocate collectively for funding, impact greater as a group  
  - Identify useful resources ‚Äì learning activities, reference/cheat sheets, tools to scaffold FLOSS work in academic settings, etc‚Ä¶ maybe schedule a sprint to do a collective brain dump?
