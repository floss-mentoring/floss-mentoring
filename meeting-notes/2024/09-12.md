### 📝 Notes

- Kendall \- ex-maintainer for OpenStack  
  - 200 contributors per 6 mo. release cycle  
  - Kendall herself has mentored \~6-12 students across 2-3 sub projects (some through Outreachy, some through university collaborations)  
  - Re: growth/goals 	  
    - Establish more mentors within community   
    - Part of this is “mentoring the mentors” \- plan to capture and be able to share about this  
    - Expand more beyond US (currently most participants are American), more diversity of students  
  - Why doesn’t engagement continue? // What can we do to support this?  
    - Not understood that people can get paid to work on open source  
    - Not understood that you can also work upstream/downstream  
    - Education can help just to raise awareness, shape perceptions of this  
    - Relationships can help students to remain engaged, but it’s hard to force this  
  - Showing historical PRs to students early on can help set expectations around communication, timeline, etc. – plus show that this process can be messy, involve a lot of moving parts and people  
- Steve \- Open Energy Dashboard (OED) maintainer  
  - Over last academic year/summer, 110 students (most working for a full semester)  
  - Steve personally mentors most/all of the students for their first semester (30-90 min/week with each student or team)  
  - Focus on engaging students that haven’t historically had access to these kinds of opportunities (mostly in US)  
  - Really try to give students a task that can be finished during their time, so that they’re banking PRs  
  - Re: growth/goals  
    - Working with students means (in a sense) having a captive audience :) – but, there is constant turnover, a minority remain involved beyond their initial experience  
    - Continuing to ask feedback to learn about student experience, create helpful documentation with some of this  
    - Would like to move towards peer mentorship, with students who’ve worked on the project becoming the first line of contact for questions – empowers students, helps make overall effort more sustainable (specifically, a nonprofit site could get a student mentor associated with it – help bridge also needs of client in addition to technical lead)  
  - Why doesn’t engagement continue? // What can we do to support this?  
    - Students *do* credit such experiences with helping them to get jobs  
    - Students are aware of variety of ways they can continue to engage/grow, but sometimes it’s the crunch of finishing school, working on a capstone project, etc – students are busy and under pressure  
    - Summer possibly a better time to engage, but strong students are often chasing more traditional summer internships  
    - Students do sometimes observe cultural differences between open source and other tech culture, and they appreciate this\! Just takes time \+ experiencing it personally  
    - Students are sometimes shocked that we want to continue working with them beyond the end of a formal experience :)  
    - It’s a balance to pushing students with supporting being successful/building confident  
    - Helpful to model for students that we all make plenty of mistakes coding; our expertise is more diverse than just this  
    - Commenting on PRs \- so important to thank contributors, suggest ways of doing things (even if you already know the “best” way through it) – sometimes can also be useful to communicate off GitHub if something is really off, extra care is needed, etc.  
    - Social impact can be a hook to continue engaging, as can reputation for high-touch mentorship  
    - Sometimes “moving on” can be leveraging this experience for something else productive  
  - Dynamics of feedback are complicated\! It can take a lot to get over the hurdle of submitting your first PR, issue, etc. – we can support them by doing a preliminary review before it goes straight to the project – unique for this to come from *within* the project/community  
- On why students don’t stick around  
  - Tyler:   
    - Students may not realize the extent of experience they gained; maybe asking them explicitly to reflect on this can help bring it to the foreground  
    - Some students report feeling embarrassed about their contribution(s) not being good enough, merged quickly enough etc  
    - Project can be more explicit about the value/impact of contributions – not always clear to students the impact of their work  
    - Students sometimes don’t know they’re “allowed” to keep contributing, that the project would want them to stick around/that they’re adding value already  
    - Structure and process to scaffold how they plan to continue contributing may be helpful \- also, helping students triage issues to pick one  
  - Wes:   
    - Some students get really good, but their self-perception doesn’t always catch up – would be great to have more data on this  
    - Critical to give *constructive* feedback on PRs; someone has just *given* you something (even if it's part of a class)  
- What can we do to help?  
  - Best practices that maintainers can look at and use as a baseline (use our convo today as a starting point\!) \-\> consider working with OSI to get more eyes on it  
  - It does take time investment to offer the kind of high-touch, effective, intentional mentorship we’re talking about… maybe useful just for projects to refine their goals? Can we author questions to help guide these conversations?  
  - $$$, always \- pay peer mentors $, for example \- what could we try on a larger scale?  
  - Make clear the value of pay \+ experience being gained \- maybe we can help with narrative? Creating videos, etc \- emphasize social phenomenon of open source
