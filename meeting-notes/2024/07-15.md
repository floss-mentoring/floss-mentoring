### üìù Notes

- FLOSS mentoring in higher education ‚Äì the mentee/student experience  
  - Size of open source projects can be a barrier; mentors make it easier \- they can help direct your attention  
  - Challenges  
    - Balancing the structure of the course or internship‚Äôs schedule with the fast moving open source community moving at its own pace \- can be navigated with good communication, but it‚Äôs still difficult  
      - Disconnect in time scales between a student and an open source community  
    - Not fully understanding what the purpose was, the size of the impact of the mentee contribution \- being more specific about the scale the project is being used at, how many people will make use of it helps students/mentees   
    - Students care more about quality of documentation and mentors themselves more than the focus of the project  
    - Mentees that have reported back after being hired have mentioned that an open source experience has been really impactful  
    - Different community cultures that are an old hat to people that have been around the block for a while in a community are not familiar can be hard for students to get used to  
      - Anecdote \- students didn‚Äôt know that ALL tests had to pass for the code to merge, not just 9/10 (A- grade level)   
    - Dev environments can take a long time to setup  
    - Mentees were surprised how much of it is poking around and googling  
    - Communication is HARD  
      - Some people are better at it than others, but there will be all levels in a community   
      - Individual contributor cultures clashing in large open source projects can also be difficult to navigate  
  - What advice or suggestions do you have for open source mentors/instructors?  
    - Add smiles\! :) Sound less grumpy  
    - If projects are not treating new contributors (students, mentees) etc with more understanding and care, it can lead to issues   
    - Mentors being more explicit about expectations of mentees can be helpful  
    - There are so many projects out there \- if you don‚Äôt like a particular one, try something else or build your own
