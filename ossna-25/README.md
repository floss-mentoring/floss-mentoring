Our agenda is flexible, as a starting point we have brainstormed the following potential discussion topics:

- Addressing and preparing for incidents of mentor misconduct
- Developments in mentor training and recruitment strategies
- When mentees are working as part of a team, what can be done to prevent one contributor from doing all the work?
- How should mentorship programs address contributor overuse of AI tools?
- Helping first-time contributors build trust and rapport with maintainers
- Supporting inclusive engagement across languages and timezones

üìù Throughout your discussions, we encourage you to take notes and submit them as a pull request to this repository.

Contributions sharing your experiences in FLOSS mentoring are also welcome! Consider sharing details of your mentorship program, solutions you have implemented, or problems you are facing in need of a solution.
