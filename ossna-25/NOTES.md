Here are the notes from our unconference session. Thank you everybody for contributing!

# "START HERE" Guide for New Contributors
- For coders, the starting path is a lot more obvious. For people who havenâ€™t coded before, what does the pathway look like?

## How can contributors get started?
- Find a project that you like, start reading the docs! Fix a typo, grammar, etc. as a starting point

## What can maintainers do to make it easier for first time contributors?
- CONTRIBUTING.md
  - dev environment setup
  - Keep in mind "[beginners mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin)". Also relevant "[Average Familiarity](https://xkcd.com/2501/)"
  - Writing commit messages, set expectations for maintainer response times
- Use "Good first issue" tags
  - How do you identify what a GFI is?
  - No common standard
  - Sometimes GFI are things that are obvious, or have good relevant docs to use as a starting point
  - CNCF Has "Take a penny, leave a penny" policy - after first contribution, mentee makes a GFI of their own, to be solved by a future mentee
  - Watch for stale GFIs, can be good indicator for things that are not actually GFIs
    - perhaps this can be automated
- Intentionally create typos, grammar mistakes in docs to create easy entrypoints for a fix
- Find the right people to represent your project. 
- Run IRL hackathons/sprints at meetups and conferences. In person connections make a big difference!
  - Helps maintainers feel less "scary" and more approachable.
- Find creative ways to teach and do outreach (like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube)
  - Juanita Gomez has done this with Scientific Python
