## FLOSS-Mentoring

### 💁 Who are we?

FLOSS-Mentoring is a cross-sector community of practice supporting mentorship in open source, composed of educators, researchers, maintainers, program/organization directors, and more. 

The group was founded in 2023 by individuals from UCSC OSPO, NumFocus, the Open Infrastructure Foundation, and CodeDay, and now has over 60 members!

### 💻 Join a monthly call

We typically meet on the second Monday/Tuesday of each month (depending on your timezone) - and we are currently trialing alternating times to support broader global participation. ***[Subscribe here to receive calendar invites with Zoom links.](https://groups.google.com/g/floss-mentoring)***

Each call includes a short presentation from a member sharing their experiences and/or seeking feedback, plus updates from smaller working groups on proposals, proposals, events, etc. Please join us if you're engaged in open source mentorship... or would like to be!
